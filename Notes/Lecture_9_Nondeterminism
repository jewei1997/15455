Lecture 9: Nondeterminism

Nondeterminism - a nonrealistic feature you can add to models of computation

Pseudocode with Nondeterminism
 - Add "goto-both", which is like a parallel fork

Definition: Nondeterminism algo (overall) accepts iff at least 1 branch accepts and rejects if all branches reject

Definition: Running time: max running time over all branches

Definition: A Nondeterminism algo is a decider if all branches halt

E.g. SAT (Formula SAT) solvable in polytime with a nondeterministic algo
Call this algo "N"
On output Phi with n variables, allocate x[1...n], i = 0
"Top": i++; 
 - if: i > n, then goto "Check"
 - else: "goto-both": "Write 0", "Write 1"
"Write 0": x[i] = 0, goto "Top"
"Write 1": x[i] = 1, goto "Top"
"Check": check if x satisfies Phi, if so, accept, else reject (this is totally deterministic)

Observations:
 - will spawn exactly 2^n branches
